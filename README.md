# PyGUI
One of three Python related projects for my final semester, this one to build a GUI using Python. As I stated in my PyTerm repo, it was nice to go back to my roots of programming and get this done. I was reminded how finicky TKinter can be when making a GUI and how specific I am with frame placement and geometry, opting to use solid values for width, height, and positioning, over the standard pack method. While I always love making playable experiences, specially with a visual element, this tried my patience a bit with the amount of rewriting the same blocks of code to implement similar objects (writing the same frame generation 3-4 times for each frame that I had). All in all, pretty fun, and would definitely be interested in making code that writes code to automate the GUI creation.


#To Run: Download the files and open them in your Python IDE of choice, and run main.py!
